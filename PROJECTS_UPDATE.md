# Portfolio Projects Update

## Changes Made

The Projects section has been updated to showcase your web development work instead of the previous fullstack projects.

### Updated Projects:

1. **iTech LK Store** (https://www.itechlk.store/)
   - Premium subscription accounts marketplace
   - Features: Netflix, ChatGPT Plus, Canva Pro, and more
   - 1000+ satisfied customers
   - 24/7 WhatsApp support

2. **Elanora Fashion** (https://elanora-fashion.vercel.app/)
   - Premium men's fashion e-commerce platform
   - Contemporary clothing collections
   - Categories: Shirts, Outerwear, Pants, Accessories

## Important: Replace Placeholder Images

The current images (`images/itechlk-store.webp` and `images/elanora-fashion.webp`) are **placeholder SVG files**. 

### To add real screenshots:

1. **Take screenshots of your websites:**
   - Visit each website in a browser
   - Take a high-quality screenshot (recommended: 800x600px or larger)
   - Capture the hero/landing section for best visual impact

2. **Convert to WebP format:**
   - Use an online converter like: https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp
   - Or use command line: `cwebp input.png -o output.webp`
   - Recommended quality: 80-90%

3. **Replace the files:**
   - Replace `images/itechlk-store.webp` with your iTech LK Store screenshot
   - Replace `images/elanora-fashion.webp` with your Elanora Fashion screenshot

4. **Optimize for web:**
   - Keep file size under 200KB for fast loading
   - Maintain aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9 works well)
   - Ensure images are clear and professional

## File Changes:

- ✅ `index.html` - Updated Projects section (removed 13 projects, added 2 new ones)
- ✅ `images/itechlk-store.webp` - Placeholder image (REPLACE THIS)
- ✅ `images/elanora-fashion.webp` - Placeholder image (REPLACE THIS)
- ✅ `PROJECTS_UPDATE.md` - This documentation file

## Testing:

Open `index.html` in your browser and:
1. Navigate to the Projects section
2. Verify both project cards display correctly
3. Test the "View" buttons link to the correct websites
4. Check that the swiper/carousel works properly

## Next Steps:

1. Replace placeholder images with actual screenshots
2. Test the portfolio in different browsers
3. Deploy the updated portfolio to your hosting service

**Note:** The portfolio is now tailored for a web developer showcasing e-commerce websites instead of fullstack applications.
